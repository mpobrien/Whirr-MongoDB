# This is so that thriftserver (which is an HBase client) would would keep
# trying to connect for an extended amount of time.
# It can take some time for HBase to be functional since it requires
# both master and regionservers to be up, and currently this can take
# quite some time because the configuration phase does not run concurrently
# for different templates, and to some extent also because services
# are not started in order. (WHIRR-314)

# This makes HBase cope with the fact that ZooKeeper might be started
# (a lot) later than HBase. (for similar reasons as
