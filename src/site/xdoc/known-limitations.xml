    <p>We are striving to make each release as good as possible but there are still a set of 
    limitations that you should be aware of. The following issues are known to exist in the 0.6.0 release of Whirr.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Hadoop namenode and the jobtracker must share the same machine. <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WHIRR-337">WHIRR-337</a></li>
      <li>The HBase thrift server can only run on a machine that it's also running a different HBase role like hbase-master or hbase-regionserver. <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WHIRR-342">WHIRR-342</a></li>
      <li>The "jclouds.aws-s3.endpoint" property is needed in order to use BlobCache with Amazon AWS in a region besides us-east-1. See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WHIRR-349#comment-13084590">WHIRR-349</a> for more details</li>
