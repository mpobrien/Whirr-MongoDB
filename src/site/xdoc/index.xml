    <p>Apache Whirr is a set of libraries for running cloud services. Whirr is currently in the 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</a> .</p>
    <p>Whirr provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A cloud-neutral way to run services. You don't have to worry about the idiosyncrasies of
      each provider.</li>
      <li>A common service API. The details of provisioning are particular to the service.</li>
      <li>Smart defaults for services. You can get a properly configured system running quickly,
      while still being able to override settings as needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also use Whirr as a command line tool for deploying clusters.</p>
    <p>Find out more about Whirr at our 
    <a class="externalLink" href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WHIRR">wiki</a> .</p>
    
    <subsection name="Getting Started"></subsection>

    <p>You can use Whirr's CLI or APIs to 
    <a href="quick-start-guide.html">get started with Whirr</a> .</p>
    <p>There is also an 
    <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> which covers how to achieve common tasks with Whirr, and a 
    <a href="configuration-guide.html">configuration guide</a> for reference.</p>
    
    <subsection name="Getting Involved"></subsection>

    <p>Have you got a suggestion for improving Whirr? It's easy to

    <subsection name="Which services and cloud providers are supported?"></subsection>

    <p>Whirr uses 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/">jclouds</a> for provisioning,
    so in principle it should support all the cloud providers that jclouds supports. The following
    table shows the cloud provider and service combinations that have been tested.</p>
    <table align="center" border="0">
      <tr valign="top">
        <th align="center">
          <b>Cloud provider</b>
        </th>
        <th align="center">
          <b>Cassandra</b>
        </th>
        <th align="center">
          <b>Hadoop</b>
        </th>
        <th align="center">
          <b>ZooKeeper</b>
        </th>
        <th align="center">

    <p>For development and local testing we are also supporting the BYON (bring your own nodes)
    jclouds provider. Check the 
    <i>recipes</i> folder for a configuration sample.</p>
    
    <subsection name="What server operating systems are supported?"></subsection>

    <p>Each release is tested by running the integration tests on Ubuntu Server 10.04. All setup
    scripts should also work on Centos 5.x but we don't have a formal testing procedure in place
    right now.</p>
    
    <subsection name="Download"></subsection>

    <p>Download a release of Whirr from a 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/incubator/whirr/">nearby
    mirror</a> .</p>

    <subsection name="Known Limitations"></subsection>

    We are striving to make each release as good as possible but there are still a set of 
    limitations that you should be aware of. The following issues are known to exist in the 0.6.0 release of Whirr.

    <ul>
      <li>The Hadoop namenode and the jobtracker must share the same machine. <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WHIRR-337">WHIRR-337</a></li>
      <li>The HBase thrift server can only run on a machine that it's also running a different HBase role like hbase-master or hbase-regionserver. <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WHIRR-342">WHIRR-342</a></li>
      <li>The "jclouds.aws-s3.endpoint" property is needed in order to use BlobCache with Amazon AWS in a region besides us-east-1. See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WHIRR-349#comment-13084590">WHIRR-349</a> for more details</li>
    </ul>
    
    <subsection name="History"></subsection>

    <p>The code that would become Whirr started out in 2007 as some 
    <a class="externalLink" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-884">bash scripts in
    Apache Hadoop</a> for running Hadoop clusters on EC2. Later the scripts were 
    <a class="externalLink" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WHIRR-3">ported to
    Python</a> for extra features (such as EBS support) and a wider range of cloud providers. These
    Python scripts are no longer supported, but can be found in the 0.5.0 release and the
    <i>contrib-python</i> SVN branch.</p>
    <p>In May 2010 the 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://incubator.apache.org/whirr">Apache Whirr
    Incubator</a> project was started to give a home to the existing work that had been done, but
    also to create a Java version using 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/">jclouds</a> as the cloud
    provisioning library. jclouds supports many providers and has a very rich API for running code
    on instances, so it provides a very solid foundation for building Whirr on.</p>
