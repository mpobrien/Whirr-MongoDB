    <p>Apache Whirr is a set of libraries for running cloud services.</p>
    <p>Whirr provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A cloud-neutral way to run services. You don't have to worry about the idiosyncrasies of
      each provider.</li>
      <li>A common service API. The details of provisioning are particular to the service.</li>
      <li>Smart defaults for services. You can get a properly configured system running quickly,
      while still being able to override settings as needed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also use Whirr as a command line tool for deploying clusters.</p>
