# Voldemort Cluster on AWS EC2
# 

# Read the Configuration Guide for more info:
# http://incubator.apache.org/whirr/configuration-guide.html

# Change the cluster name here
whirr.cluster-name=voldemort

# Change the number of machines in the cluster here
whirr.instance-templates=2 voldemort 

# For EC2 set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables.
whirr.provider=aws-ec2
whirr.identity=${env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}
whirr.credential=${env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}

# By default use the user system SSH keys. Override them here.
whirr.private-key-file=${sys:user.home}/.ssh/id_rsa
whirr.public-key-file=${whirr.private-key-file}.pub

# By default we use a stock build and configuration, but these can be overridden
# by providing URLs for the build and configuration. Note: the configuration is
# a flat hierarchy, there are no expected sub-directories in whirr.voldemort.conf.url, 
# just the two files server.properties and stores.xml.
