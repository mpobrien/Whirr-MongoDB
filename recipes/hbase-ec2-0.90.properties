# The Hadoop version to use. See http://hbase.apache.org/book/hadoop.html
# The default Hadoop version used by Whirr does not fulfill the HBase 0.90.x requirements.
# Whirr will replace the hadoop-core jar in HBase with the one from the actually installed Hadoop.
# This example uses Cloudera's CDH3.
